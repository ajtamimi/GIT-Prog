Paragraph1 = """
One day a rabbit was boasting about,how fast he could run.
He was laughing at the turtle for being so slow. Much to the
rabbit’s surprise, the turtle challenged him to a race. The rabbit
thought this was a good joke and accepted the challenge. The fox
was to be the umpire of the race. As the race began, the rabbit
raced way ahead of the turtle, just like everyone thought.
The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle
anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short
nap. Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the
finish line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking step
by step by step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got.
He just kept going.
However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up.
He could not see the turtle anywhere! He went at full speed to
the finish line but found the turtle there waiting for him.

Flights resumed Thursday at an Istanbul airport after a Pegasus Airline
passenger jet skidded off a runway, killing three people and injuring 180 others.
Sabiha Gokcen Airport restarted operations at around 4 am though delays and
cancellations continued.
On Wednesday evening, a Boeing 737 operated by the low-cost airline landed 
from Izmir on Turkey's western coast during strong winds and heavy rain and 
overshot the runway. It skidded about 50 to 60 meters before it dropped into 
the ditch from a height of about 30 meters, according to the city's governor, 
Ali Yerlikaya.
The plane, carrying 177 passengers and six crew members, broke up into three 
parts upon impact. The plane was 11 years old, according to flight tracking 
website Flightradar24.
Live images broadcast on Turkish television showed several people climbing 
through a large crack in the severed aircraft and escaping onto one of the 
wings at the rear.
Yerlikaya, speaking early Thursday, said all those injured were stable and 
four people had significant injuries, but he didn't give details on how severe 
they were.
The passengers included 22 people from 12 countries.
Pegasus Airlines changed its logo on Twitter to a blackened version in a sign 
of mourning, and said its "priority is to support the relatives and friends 
who have lost loved ones.” Its fleet of 83 planes fly to more than 100 
destinations.
Police guarded the wreckage Thursday morning.
Another Pegasus Airlines plane skidded off the runway at the same airport 
in Istanbul on Jan. 7, causing the temporary closure of the airport. 
There were no injuries.
In January 2018, another Boeing 737 in the Pegasus fleet slid off a runway
at Trabzon Airport in northeastern Turkey. The plane came to rest in the 
dirt above the Black Sea with its nose pointed toward the water.
No one was injured.
